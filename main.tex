\section{Objective:}

The project aims to develop an end-to-end (e2e) database application for an online retail store. The primary focus is crafting a robust back-end system that will intricately manage and optimize the interactions between various data entities. The design will encompass a meticulous selection of data entities, establishing relationships, and the imposition of constraints to ensure data integrity. This endeavor addresses common challenges like data redundancy and concurrent access issues and fortifying critical information security. Additionally, the application will be demonstrated through a user-friendly front-end interface.

\
\section{We shall try to achieve the following:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define data entities such as Customers, Products, Orders, and Vendors.

\item Establish relationships and constraints between these entities to ensure data integrity.

\item Implement mechanisms for populating the database with fictional data.

\item Develop a user-friendly GUI interface to facilitate seamless navigation, product search, and efficient order management.

\item Inventory Management: Track product availability and update inventory levels. Notify vendors and admin when a stock falls below a certain threshold.

\item Implement password protection and account recovery mechanisms for all accounts to protect user data and transactions.

\item Track sales data, generate sales reports, and provide insights for decision-making.
\end{itemize}
\
\section{Stakeholder functionalities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Customers:} Register, Browse products, Place orders, View order history, Add products to wish list.
\item \textbf{Vendors:} Register, Manage product details, Track sales.
\end{itemize}
